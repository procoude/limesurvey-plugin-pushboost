# PushBoost

The limesurvey-plugin PushBoost helps you as the leader of a survey to keep up-to-date. You will receive an email everytime you reached a milestone concerning the number of participants. The plugin will let you know how many people participated in your online-survey. You can choose yourself how often you would like to receive such an email (e.g. every 10th participant, every 50th and so on).
