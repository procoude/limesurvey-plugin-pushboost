# PushBoost

The LimeSurvey-plugin PushBoost helps you as the leader of a survey to keep up-to-date. You will receive an email everytime you reached a milestone concerning the number of participants. The plugin will let you know how many people participated in your online-survey. You can choose yourself how often you would like to receive such an email (e.g. every 10th participant, every 50th and so on).

## Getting Started

LimeSurvey is a service for online-surveys. The data can be stored local which allows control over the examined data. LimeSurvey provides a notification function where the survey leader gets an email every time a participant finished the online-survey. PushBoost extends this function. It allows administrators to define and individually customize the notifications. The administrators can decide if they prefer receiving a notification after a defined milestone, a certain number of participants or a certain amount of time. By these customizations, the administrator will not get any spam but wanted notifications. Those notifications will be send via mail which is the most convenient way since the administrator does not have to log in to get the information. For the time-dependent
notifications, it is first necessary for the administrator to activate the CronService on the
the same web server that hosts the LimeSurvey process.

    $this->connection->createCommand("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS $wingametable (mails VARCHAR(150) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL);)->execute();
    
    //Move email-address from the survey table into the new created table
     $this->connection->createCommand("INSERT INTO $wingametable('mails') SELECT $sSgqaCode FROM $tableName WHERE $sSgqaCode IS NOT               NULL;")->excute();
     
     //Set email-addresses in survey table NULL
     $this->connection->createCommand("UPDATE $tableName SET $sSgqaCode = NULL;")->execute();
     
     //Order the content of the new table alphabetically
     $this->connection->createCommand("SELECT * FROM $wingametable ORDER BY 'mails';")->execute();
