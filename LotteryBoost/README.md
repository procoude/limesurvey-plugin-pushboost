# LotteryBoost

The limesurvey-plugin LotteryBoost helps you to randomly choose a winner for your lottery at the end of your limesurvey online-survey. The participants will provide their email-addresses at the end of the experiment which will be saved in an extra data base to guarantee the participants' anonymity. At the end of the survey, you can choose the number of winners for your lottery and the plugin will send you an email including the addresses of the lucky-ones.
